# Frutiger Aero Components

## What is Frutiger Aero?

[**Frutiger aero design**](https://frutiger-aero.org/) is  a style that was prevalent mostly in the mid-2000s and the early 2010s. 
It is characterized by its use of [skeuomorphism](), glossy textures, cloudy skies, tropical fish, water, bubbles, glass, lens flare, 
sprawling patterns, "humanism", aero glass, bokeh, Frutiger fonts, abstract tech, auroras, and bright, vibrant colors (typically white, green, and blue). 
The aesthetic's timeline coincides with the early days of Web 2.0 and the transition from feature phones to smartphones.

When thinking about frutiger aero aesthetics, we can imagine the following:
- [Windows Vista/7 Aero design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Aero)
- [Mac OS X Aqua design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_(user_interface))
- Nintendo Wii Sports design
- [iOS 6 design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_6)

The reason I chose this style is that it was my favorite aesthetic when I was a kid. I still love it today! It reminds me 
of my childhood, playing games on my pc, not having to worry about anything. In a way it is a path down the memory lane, 
to the simpler times. I love seeing a comeback of this style and that's the reason I decided to give it a try to recreate it for web.
